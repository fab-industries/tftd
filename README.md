# Thought for the Day

A small app that displays the current time of day (in 24-hour format), the current [Imperial date from _Warhammer 40,000_](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Imperial_Dating_System) and an inspirational quote from your  local [Departmento Munitorum's Commissariat](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Commissariat) office. It was written for the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) fantasy console, but can also be used standalone.

Thought for the Day is brought to you by [_**FAB INDUSTRIES**_](https://fab.industries).
